# Darcula-solid.nvim
A color-scheme that was heavily inspired by the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA default theme, but was carefully refined to bring a more pleasant, aesthetic, and contrasting experience to our beloved Neovim.

## âœ¨ Features
* [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) support
* [NvimTree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua) support
* 256 colors
* Beautiful contrasting (IntelliJ like) colors

## âš¡ Requirements
* `termguicolors` enabled for true color support
* (recommended) [Neovim 0.5](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases)
* (recommended) [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
